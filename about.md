My name is Gertjan Burghouts. I am a researcher in deep learning and computer vision. My passion is to create new algorithms that learn to analyze the visual world around us.

I am part of a great team at TNO: the Intelligent Imaging group. Our research is applied to image & video understanding, and robotics. My personal ambition is to enable learning with few labels and to leverage prior knowledge in the learning process.

Our team is part of DARPA's program Learning with Less Labels. We are a partner in the NWO program Efficient Deep Learning, where I co-supervise a PhD candidate (David Zhang) together with the University of Amsterdam (Cees Snoek), on learning sets and graphs. In the Appl.AI research program at TNO, we do a project about robotics and autonomy, called SNOW. In SNOW, I lead the research on context awareness for robotics.

More details about my research can be found under Research.
