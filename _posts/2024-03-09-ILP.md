We are working on a new area that we find fascinating: Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). 
ILP is helpful to find logical patterns, e.g. in your object detections. 
We argue that it enables Understanding, as it outputs programs about relations between objects, in terms of first-order logic. 

We have some interesting findings: ILP can find complex patterns better than statistical models, even the advanced ones such as a Graph Neural Network. 
Moreover, itâ€™s explainable!

Can you find the pattern in the images below? ILP can!
