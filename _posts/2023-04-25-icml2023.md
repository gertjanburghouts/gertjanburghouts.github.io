Slot attention is a powerful method for object-centric modeling in images and videos. But it is limited in separating similar objects. We extend it with an attention module based on optimal transport, to improve such tie-breaking.

We propose MESH (Minimize Entropy of Sinkhorn): a cross-attention module that combines the tiebreaking properties of unregularized optimal transport with the speed of regularized optimal transport. We evaluate slot attention using MESH on multiple object-centric learning benchmarks and find significant improvements over slot attention in every setting.
