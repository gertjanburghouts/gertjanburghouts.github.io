Spatial configurations of multiple objects in images can tell us something about what is going on. 
Here you see the result of searching for two aligned helicopters without any other objects nearby.

Another example is a helicopter on a ship.

The results are obtained by probabilistic spatial reasoning. 
We used Scallop for this purpose, a neuro-symbolic programming framework (NeurIPS 2021). 
The program consists of multiple relations such as: on(a, b), nearby(a, b), facing(a, b), next-to(a, b), classname(a), etc.
