Do you want to boost image classification, long-tailed recognition, out-of-distribution and open-set recognition with single line of code? 

Read our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08704">paper</a> titled: Maximum Class Separation as Inductive Bias in One Matrix. 
For each class, it creates a vector that is maximally apart from all other classes, in a nice mathematical closed-form solution.

Wonderful collaboration with Tejaswi Kasarla, Pascal Mettes, Max van Spengler, Elise van der Pol and Rita Cucchiara!
