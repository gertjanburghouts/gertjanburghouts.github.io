I was on London at the Royal Society, for a symposium and debate to go beyond the symbols vs signals dichotomy. 
Professors from Harvard, Stanford, Oxford, Leuven, Deepmind talked about neurosymbolic AI, continual learning, foundation models, agents, large language models, formal languages, and more. 

An impressive atmosphere with statues and writings of historic scientists (e.g. Boole). 
Many thoughts about the future of AI: about agents having and achieving goals, using prior knowledge, reward machines, guidance through language, formal mechanisms for provability and safety guardrails.
