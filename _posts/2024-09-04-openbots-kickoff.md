OpenBots: Open world autonomy of robots by common sense AI. 

Advanced robots are remarkable successful in conducting a specific task, 
yet only when operating in static and predictable environments. 
Unfortunately, the operability of existing robotics stalls catastrophically 
when significant or unpredictable events occur, as it breaks their 
closed world assumption. We propose the OpenBots project to turn robots 
from automated systems operating in a closed-world into autonomous systems 
that operate in the real, open world. We will do so by injecting common 
sense principles into the perception and planning processes of robots to 
extend their artificial intelligence abilities, so that robots may solve 
newly encountered situations autonomously.

Today was the kickoff,
