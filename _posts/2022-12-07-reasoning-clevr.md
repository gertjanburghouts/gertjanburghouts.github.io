In crowded scenes, it is hard to keep track of objects.
Sometimes they will be invisible because they are occluded.
Meanwhile, something may happen, like a collision.

We devised a method that can extrapolate the tracks and reason whether a collision may happen.
The camera feed is temporarily blocked, so for a moment the computer is blind.
Still we can recover whether a collision is about to happen.
