We want to reasoning about objects and their relationships. 
For instance, finding a woman who wears glasses next to a man who also wears glasses in the image below. 
With neuro-symbolic programming, we are able to find this combination.

Moreover, we can infer which objects in the image relate to which 
entities from the logical definitions (from the neuro-symbolic program). 
Here, the woman and the man, respectively. 

This attribution is helpful for explainability of the hypothesis. 
It's also helpful for further reasoning, e.g., to acquire additional information about these entities of interest.
