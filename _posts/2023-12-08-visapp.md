Paper accepted at International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications (VISAPP). 

It's about visual recognition of new classes from earlier ones, by a mapping derived from attributes or a Large Language Model (LLM). 
For instance, the new bird (left) is recognized by mixing the properties of known birds (right). 
Such knowledge is available from LLMs, in a way that is almost as good as expert knowledge (312 manual attributes).
