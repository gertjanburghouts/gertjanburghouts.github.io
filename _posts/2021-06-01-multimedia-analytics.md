For the last years, I was part of a NATO research group about multimedia analytics. 
The goal was to invent new ways of making use of multiple modalities. 

Our focus was on social media (text, images) and videos. 
For this work, we received an Excellence Award from NATO.

Our contribution was to detect persons and vehicles in aerial images, from both daylight and infrared cameras. 
Furthermore, we described these objects by their colors, time and world coordinates (by fusion with the sensor's metadata and map information). 
A GUI enabled a user to search for these objects, on maps, in video, and reconstruct timelines of appearances.
