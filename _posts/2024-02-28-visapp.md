Presenting our work on zero- and few-shot learning at the VISAPP conference in Rome. 

We synthesize visual classifiers via semantic knowledge about the classes. 
These synthesized classifiers can classify novel, unseen classes due to semantic transfer. 
The classifiers are ordinary classifiers that can be optimized further with a few training labels once they become available.

A good crowd with an interesting discussion afterwards. 
Happy to receiving positive feedback and many good questions.
