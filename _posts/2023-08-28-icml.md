David presented our paper at ICML, Hawai. The paper was about object-centric representations.
The popular method Slot Attention was improved by a new way of learning good image features.

The new learning function involves optimal transport.
Changing the cost between features during the learning, led to better focus on the objects.
This resulted in better object discovery: segmenting new objects in visual scenes.
